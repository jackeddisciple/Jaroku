// THE RIG — recipe in, character out, and the recipe is the ONLY state, so
// the same JSON gives the same character on any machine.
//
//   recipe = {
//     seed,                       // one integer; the whole character
//     body,                       // which shape (one for now: sphere)
//     palette, colorIx,           // which five colours, and which of them
//     material,                   // one of `MATERIAL_IDS`
//     parts: { [id]: { params, rr? } }
//   }
//
// Every part gen()s its params, the layout measures once, each part
// pushes SPECS, and this file stamps them. A part never touches
// three.js and never builds a material — it names a colour from the
// layout and a shape from the catalogue.
//
// The face comes back as a map of meshes (`eyeL`, `mouth`, …) and that
// map is the animation surface: a blink is `eyeL.scale.y`, a glance is
// a nudge in x, and neither costs a rebuild. That is the whole reason
// the features are separate objects instead of one welded model.
