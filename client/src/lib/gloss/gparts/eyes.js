// plate per side — plus a border, a pupil and a lid on the white-eyed
// ones — and every one of them lands through `L.at`, so none of them
// know what shape they are sitting on.
//
// There WAS a third plate: a rim, the same outline a size larger in a
// darker body tone, standing in for the carved socket of the reference.
// It was removed. Against saturated vinyl a .74 shade reads as shadow,
// but these palettes are pale and low-contrast, so it came out as a
// second COLOUR rather than a darker one — and with no concavity behind
// it there was no cue saying "recess" either. It read as two stacked
// shapes, because that is what it was. If the carved look is wanted
// back it has to be real geometry: depth in the rim and the ink sunk
// into it, not a colour standing in for a shadow.

// outline + the numbers that outline reads.
//   `shut`   already a closed lid, so the blink leaves it alone
//   `sclera` a WHITE eye with a dark pupil laid on it — two plates,
