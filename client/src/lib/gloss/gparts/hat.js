// HEADWEAR — the last of the extras and the loudest, because unlike a
// mark or a pair of glasses a hat changes the SILHOUETTE, which is the
// only thing that survives at sheet scale.
//
// Its relationship with the HAIR splits the catalogue in two, and
// getting that wrong is what a first pass does:
//
//   HUG    a beanie or a cap is PULLED ON, and a real one compresses
//          the hair under it — it wants the head's own radius plus a
//          little, and the hair poking out below the rim is the read.
//          Sized to clear a big soft cut instead, it stands a whole
//          hair's volume off the skull at every height, including
//          down at the ears where there is no hair at all, and comes
//          out as a bowl balanced on the head.
//   PERCH  a headband, a bow, a flower, a crown — these sit ON TOP of
//          whatever is up there and genuinely need `L.hairTop`, which
//          the hair publishes via `hairOuter`. Same edge as the eyes
//          publishing `eyeProud` for the spectacles.
//
// The vocabulary is deliberately three shapes of thing:
//
//   DOME   a sphere cut short (`dome`) — a beanie, a cap's crown
//   BAND   a sphere ZONE, cut at both ends (`domeFrom`) — a brim, a
//          cuff, a headband. This is what `domeFrom` was added for.
//   PLATE  the flat stuff — a bow, a flower, a crown's points
//
// Colour comes off the character's own palette (`warm`, `lite`, `ink`) rather
// than a new table. A hat in an unrelated colour is a different
// object; a hat in the family's colours is an accessory.

/**
 * Does this hat go on a BARE head?
 *
 * A beanie and a headband are pulled ON, and there is no arrangement of
 * sizes that lets one share a skull with a big soft haircut: sized to
 * clear the hair it is a bowl balanced on the head, sized to the skull
 * it vanishes underneath, and squashing the hair under its rim — which
 * was built, and worked — still leaves the two fighting for the same
 * few millimetres at every seed. So they are simply worn on a bare
 * head, which is a real look and needs no negotiation at all.
 *
 * `ghair.js` reads this off the LAYOUT and builds nothing. The hats
 * that PERCH (a bow, a flower, a crown) sit on top of the hair as
 * before and are not listed here.
