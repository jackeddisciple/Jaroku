// THE CREST — ears, horns, and whatever else breaks the top of the
// head. This is the other half of why the reference reads as a sheet
// of CREATURES: a cat, a bear and a bunny are the same ball with the
// same face, told apart entirely by what sticks up. The silhouette is
// doing the species work.
//
// Ears are PLATES, like the face: flat shapes with a bevelled rim,
// facing the camera. That is not a cheat — the reference characters' ears
// really are this flat — and it means an inner-ear is just a smaller
// warm plate on top, the way an eye's pupil is. They stand on
// `L.top(t)`, the layout's rim-of-the-head anchor, tilted a little
// toward the surface normal so a pair fans outward.
