// Every style is stacked plates, the same trick as a pupil on a white:
// a FRAME (a ring outline, so it is a frame rather than a disc) and,
// where the style wants one, a LENS filled behind it. The catalogue is
// really two questions — round or square, and see-through or not.
//
// WHERE THEY SIT is the whole difficulty, and it is not a constant. An
// `orb` eye is a ball standing three quarters of its own radius off the
// head; a plate eye is almost flush. So the eyes publish `eyeProud` and
// the layout hands it over — spectacles placed for a flat eye cut
// straight through an eyeball, which is exactly what happened.
