// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// THE CASTING — the third copy of the project's oldest idea, and on
// purpose the third copy of the code: the gloss generator shares an
// idea with the drawn and voxel ones, not a runtime.
//
// A species is a table of loaded dice per part id:
//
//   { style: { bear: 90, none: 10 } }   an object → weighted pick, and
//                                       what you leave out CANNOT happen
//   { size: [.9, 1.2] }                 an array  → a number in range
//   { teeth: .85 }                      a number  → a probability
//
// Anything a profile does not mention keeps the part's own default, so
// a profile states only what makes that species different. A species
// may also bias the BODY form (sphere vs cube) — but never the palette
// or the material: what a character is made of is a separate lever, and a
// lavender bear is still a bear. The EARS do the species work, and
// after the eye patch and the muzzle were both cut they do nearly all
// of it — which is worth knowing before adding a species: if it cannot
// be told apart by its silhouette, it has nothing to be told apart by.
//
// A species may also NAME the body forms it may be poured as, and the
// two BENT ones (`rock`, `slime`) are where that matters most: a lumpy
// rock is a creature and a humanoid is not one, so the humanoid's
// profile lists the two forms a person can be.
//
// `wildcard` is the free roll — the sheet the lab had before species
// existed. It stays the biggest slice on purpose: the casting is there
// to make the compound characters (bunny, robot) arrive assembled, not
// to turn the generator into eight fixed characters.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------

// A species may also weight the STANCE (none / biped) the same way it
// weights the body form. Head-only stays everyone's biggest slice — it
// is the house look — and the lump species pin it, because a slime
// with legs contradicts what a slime is.
