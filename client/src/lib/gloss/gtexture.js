// ---------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TILE BAKERY — `gshape.js` cuts and stamps, this one WEAVES,
// TURNS and CRACKS. Four finishes in `gmedia.js` need a surface that
// parameters alone cannot say: a knit stitch, a lathe's ring grain, a
// printer's layer lines, a glaze's crazing. Every one of them is baked
// here, procedurally, into a canvas — nothing is loaded, the same way
// the studio is a hand-built room and the cyc is a gradient.
//
// THREE RULES.
//
// 1. A TILE IS BAKED ONCE. Every generator below is wrapped in a lazy
//    singleton, because the material factory caches on colour and a
//    palette would otherwise re-weave the same jumper twelve times.
//
// 2. A TILE MUST WRAP. It is laid on `solidGeometry`'s UVs, which come
//    straight off `SphereGeometry`: u runs once around the equator, v
//    from pole to pole. So a pattern is drawn with its neighbours
//    already present outside the edges, or built out of terms that are
//    periodic by construction, and the seam has nothing to show.
//
// 3. THE BODY ONLY. These land on the shell and never on a face
//    feature — a plate is an `ExtrudeGeometry` whose UVs are three's
//    world-space default, which is to say noise. `gmedia.js` enforces
//    that; this file only has to be worth laying down.
//
// A note on which way is up: a normal map here is OpenGL convention
// (+Y up) and `CanvasTexture` uploads with `flipY`, so canvas y runs
// OPPOSITE to v. That is why the green channel takes +dy and the red
// takes −dx below. Get it backwards and every bump becomes a dent —
// which is legible, but only once you know to look for it.
